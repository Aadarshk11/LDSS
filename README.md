<p>Legal Decision Support System is a prototype that solves one of the problem statement from smart india hackathon.<br><br> Problem Statement: In the legal system, reading through firs (first information reports) to identify the correct ipc (indian penal code) or bns (bare act section numbers) sections can be a slow and complex process. Legal professionals and law enforcement often need to manually analyze these reports, which can lead to delays and errors. The goal is to create an ai system that can quickly and accurately identify the relevant legal sections from an fir, along with the associated punishments. This will help save time, reduce errors, and ensure consistency in legal interpretation.
